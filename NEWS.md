# test2norm 0.2.0

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.

## New Features
* Two functions were added: raw2scaled() and score2adjust(). These functions
separately perform 2 steps that are done within the test2norm() function.
Function raw2scaled() converts raw test scores to scaled scores and function
score2adjust() calculates demographically adjusted scores.
