# test2norm 0.2.1

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.

## New Features
* Version 0.2.0. Two functions were added: raw2scaled() and score2adjust(). 
These functions separately perform 2 steps that are done within the test2norm() 
function. Function raw2scaled() converts raw test scores to scaled scores and 
function score2adjust() calculates demographically adjusted scores. 

* Version 0.2.1. Minor changes to arguments rnd.a and rnd.s making FALSE the
default option.
