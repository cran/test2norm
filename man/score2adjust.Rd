\title{Convert neuropsychological test scores to demographically adjusted norms.}
\usage{
score2adjust(
  data = NULL,
  test.score = NULL,
  group.id = NULL,
  control.id = NULL,
  all.controls = FALSE,
  demographics = NULL,
  mfp.alpha = 1,
  rnd.a = FALSE,
  mean.a = 50,
  sd.a = 10
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a data frame containing the variables needed for the norming
process.}

\item{test.score}{a character string specifying the name of the test to be
normed, usually the output of the \code{raw2scaled()} function.}

\item{group.id}{a character string specifying the name of the variable
containing group identification (i.e. control vs exposed/test/risk). Ignored,
if all.controls = TRUE.}

\item{control.id}{a character string specifying the label of the control
group within group.id variable. Ignored, if all.controls = TRUE.}

\item{all.controls}{a logical indicating whether all observations should be
treated as controls. Overwrites group.id and control.id.}

\item{demographics}{a single or multiple character strings (concatenated by
\code{c()} function) specifying the names of demographic predictors to be
included into normative formulas.}

\item{mfp.alpha}{a numeric value between 0 and 1 that sets significance level
for inclusion of demographic predictors into normative formula. Passed to the
\code{mfp()} function (its \code{select} argument). Default value is 1 for
inclusion of all predictors regardless of their significance.}

\item{rnd.a}{a logical indicating whether the adjusted scores (T-scores)
should be rounded. Default is FALSE.}

\item{mean.a}{numeric value for the mean of adjusted score (T-score)
distribution.}

\item{sd.a}{numeric value for the standard deviation of adjusted score
(T-score) distribution.}
}
\value{
A list consisting of 3 objects. The first two are vectors containing the
non-adjusted test scores and the calculated demographically adjusted scores.
The last item in the output list is also a list called \code{MFP.formulas}.
It contains the information for calculation of adjusted scores, including
variable transformations (if any), multiple fractional polynomial (MFP) model
coefficients, the standard deviation of residuals resulting from the MFP
modeling, and a matrix with number of rows equal to the number of predictors
and 2 columns containing powers (in numeric form) selected for variable
transformations.

\description{
Convert neuropsychological test scores to demographically adjusted norms.
}
\details{
The \code{score2adjust()} function can be used by neuropsychologists, who
wish to construct normative formulas for cognitive tests that adjust for
expected effects of demographic characteristics (e.g., age), using methods
described in Heaton et al. (2003 & 2009). The adjusted scores are sometimes
referred to as T-scores in the literature. The norming procedure makes use of
the \code{mfp()} function from the \code{mfp} package to explore nonlinear
associations between cognition and demographic variables. Detailed
description of the procedure will be found in Umlauf et al. (in revision).
